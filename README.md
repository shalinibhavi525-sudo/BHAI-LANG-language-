## 🤔 Why Bhai-Lang?

Because writing `print()` is too mainstream. We say **"Bhai bol!"** like real developers.

**Features:**
- 🇮🇳 Hinglish syntax (because we think in Hinglish anyway)
- 😂 Error messages that roast you (lovingly)
- 🔥 Works exactly like Python (but cooler)
- 💪 Built by a 17-year-old in a jungle (because why not?)

## 📖 Syntax Guide

### Hello World
```bhai
bhai bol("Namaste, duniya!");
```

### Variables

bhai naam = "Shambhavi";
bhai umar = 17;
bhai sheher = "Tripura";
```

### Math Operations
```bhai
bhai x = 10;
bhai y = 5;
bhai bol(jod(x, y));        // 15
bhai bol(ghata(x, y));      // 5
bhai bol(guna(x, y));       // 50
bhai bol(bhag_kar(x, y));   // 2
```

### Conditionals
```bhai
agar (score > 90) {
    bhai bol("Waah bhai waah! Top marks!");
} nahi_toh agar (score > 60) {
    bhai bol("Theek hai, pass toh ho gaye");
} nahi_toh {
    bhai bol("Padhai karo, bhai!");
}
```

### Loops
```bhai
// While loop
jab_tak (i < 10) {
    bhai bol(i);
    i = i + 1;
}

// For each loop
har_ek item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] {
    bhai bol(item);
}
```

### Functions

## 😂 Error Messages

Bhai-Lang doesn't just show errors. It ROASTS you (with love):
```
> bhai x = "text" + 5;
ERROR Line 1: Arre bhai! String aur number ka addition?
Ye kya kar rahe ho? 🤦‍♂️

> bhai bhag_kar(10, 0);
ERROR Line 1: Zero se divide kar rahe ho? 
Maths class mein soye the kya? 💤

> undefined_variable
ERROR Line 1: "undefined_variable" kya hai bhai?
Pehle define toh karo! Basic cheez hai! 📚
```

## 🎭 Full Disclosure: This is an Inspiration!

**IMPORTANT:** This project was inspired by the original [BhaiLang](https://github.com/DulLabs/bhai-lang) created by Aniket Singh and Rishabh Tripathi in 2022, which went viral for its hilarious Hinglish syntax.

**Why this version exists:**
- 🐍 **Python implementation** (original is TypeScript/JavaScript)
- 📚 **Educational purpose**: Learning interpreter design by building from scratch
- 😄 **Personal project**: Built in 3 hours as a fun coding exercise
- 🇮🇳 **Homage**: Paying respect to the original while exploring language implementation

**Key differences:**
- Written in Python (original is TypeScript)
- Simpler syntax (subset of features)
- Educational focus (heavily commented code)
- Built by a 17-year-old from a jungle as a learning project 🐒

**Credit where credit is due:** All respect to the original BhaiLang creators! This is a fan reimplementation, not a replacement. Check out the original at [bhailang.js.org](https://bhailang.js.org/)
